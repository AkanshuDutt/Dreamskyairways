This document outlines important information regarding our services, including flight booking, bus booking, hotel booking, cab/taxi services, tour and travel packages, visa guidance, visa processing, and travel insurance.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#0E5B63] mb-4">Third-Party Booking Disclaimer</h2>
              <p>
                Dream Sky Airways operates as a travel assistance and facilitation platform. We do not directly provide transportation or accommodation services. All bookings for flights, buses, hotels, cabs, and tour packages are processed through authorized third-party service providers, such as airlines, bus operators, hotel chains, taxi aggregators, and tour organizers. Our role is strictly limited to facilitating the booking process, providing assistance with reservations, and generating tickets or confirmations on behalf of these providers. We act as an intermediary to simplify your travel planning experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once a booking is confirmed and a ticket or voucher is issued, any subsequent matters, including but not limited to changes, modifications, refunds, or cancellations, are governed by the policies and procedures of the respective third-party provider. Dream Sky Airways does not have control over these aspects and cannot intervene in operational decisions made by the providers.
              </p>

              <p>
                Dream Sky Airways does not own, operate, or manage any airlines, bus fleets, hotels, cab services, or tour facilities. The actual delivery of services—such as flight operations, bus journeys, hotel stays, taxi rides, or package tours—is the sole responsibility of the third-party providers with whom we collaborate. We select these partners based on their reputation and compliance standards, but we cannot guarantee the quality, safety, or timeliness of their services.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#0E5B63] mb-4">Ticket & Booking Responsibility</h2>
              <p>
                Upon issuance of a ticket or booking confirmation, all responsibilities related to the service shift to the third-party provider. This includes handling delays, schedule changes, cancellations, or any disruptions due to operational issues. Dream Sky Airways is not liable for any inconveniences, losses, or damages arising from such events, as our involvement concludes with the facilitation of the booking.

              <p>
                Prices, fares, and availability displayed on our website are sourced from third-party providers and are subject to change without notice.

              <p>
                Our visa guidance and processing services are designed to assist users with documentation preparation, application submission, and procedural advice. However, the final decision on visa approval or rejection rests exclusively with the relevant embassies, consulates, or immigration authorities. Dream Sky Airways does not influence or guarantee the outcome of any visa application. We provide support based on general guidelines and cannot be held responsible for denials due to incomplete documentation, policy changes, or other factors beyond our control.
              </p>
              <p>
                Users are advised to apply well in advance and ensure all requirements are met, as visa processing times vary by country and can be affected by external circumstances.

              <p>
                Travel insurance policies offered through Dream Sky Airways are underwritten and issued by licensed third-party insurance companies. We facilitate the purchase process, but all terms, coverage limits, exclusions, claims processing, and settlements are governed by the insurer's policy documents. Users should carefully review the policy details before purchasing to understand what is covered, including medical emergencies, trip cancellations, or lost baggage. Dream Sky Airways is not liable for any disputes or denials related to insurance claims.

              <p>
                Travel inherently involves risks, and Dream Sky Airways assumes no responsibility for events such as flight delays, cancellations, natural disasters, strikes, pandemics, political unrest, or other force majeure occurrences. These are beyond our control and may impact your travel plans. We advise users to stay informed about destination-specific advisories and purchase appropriate insurance.
